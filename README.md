 App Summary: This app was designed to be a hub where ideas can come to life. The idea is simple. Sometimes we can randomly have an amazing idea. But we might not have the knowledge or skill set to bring them to life single-handedly. Why let that stop you? This is where Partners steps in. An user can post an idea. Ideas can be voted up if based on if other users think its a good idea or not. Other users can then see their ideas and if it something they want to be a part of. They can partner up with the idea originator to make the ideas come to life. So in essence, this is a team building app. Make ideas come to life through the power of teamwork.
